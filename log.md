# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Done Codecademy HTML course for assignment and half way for CSS course

**Time spent**: 13.00 PM - 19.00 PM (appr 6 hours)

**Thoughts:** Spent few hours to learn whole section of HTML still overwhelming, even though I knew the material already. Plus 2 sections for early CSS course.

## Day 2: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Done Codecademy CSS course until Typography

**Time spent**: 10.00 PM - 12.00 PM, 19.00 PM - 22.00 PM (appr 5 hours)

**Thoughts:** The assignment says until Typography. I thought I could finish it until Grid section but then I realize that's gonna make me just racing with the time without really understanding about it. I'll review Grid section more tomorrow. We learned version control and git today, that's why I decided to make this. We have group assignment, to create a simple imaginary-startup web page. I can use some grid layout properties that I just learned, I think.

## Day 3: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Half finish for group assignment

**Time spent**: 11.00 PM - 16.00 PM (appr 5 hours)

**Thoughts:** Today assignment, I took time to figure out on grid, design and color pallete. The images not working either in github, need to figure that out later.
